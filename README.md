Problem Statement:
Task Addition: The user can enter a task into the text input field and add it to the list by clicking the "Add Task" button. If the text field is empty, the task will not be added to the list.

Task Deletion: Each task has a delete button next to it. Clicking on this button removes the corresponding task from the list.

Task Marking: Each task has a checkbox next to it. The user can mark a task as completed by clicking on it. The text of completed tasks turns into a pale color to indicate to the user that the task has been completed.

Technologies and Approach Used:
Jetpack Compose: It's a modern UI toolkit for Android. By using the declarative UI paradigm, it makes UI components more understandable and manageable.

State Management: State of the application is managed using remember and mutableStateOf, making UI components sensitive to state changes and redrawn when necessary.

Material Design Components: The application uses Material3 components to provide a look and feel adhering to Material Design principles.

Potential Development Opportunities:
Storing tasks in persistent memory (e.g., a database) so that tasks are preserved even when the application is restarted.

Adding additional features such as priority or category to tasks, allowing users to better organize their tasks.

Adding filtering or sorting functionality based on the completion status of tasks, enabling users to manage their tasks more effectively.

This simple to-do list application serves as a basic example of developing modern Android applications with Jetpack Compose and can be extended to build more complex and functional applications upon it.
